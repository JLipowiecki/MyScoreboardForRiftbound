Project Summary
Scoreboard for Riftbound is a simple score-tracking tool for Riftbound matches. It replaces basic calculators commonly used during local events and provides a clear interface for adding or removing points, selecting legends, and randomly selecting which player starts the game.

Use of Riot API
At the moment, legend images are stored locally as PNG files. Once API access is granted, the app will automatically fetch legend data and artwork directly from the official Riot endpoints to ensure accuracy and up-to-date assets.

Purpose
The app is intended solely to improve player experience during tabletop Riftbound matches by offering accurate score tracking.

Additional Notes
A downloadable prototype of the application is already available for testing. API access for Riftbound is requested to ensure the app can display accurate, official legend data and stay up to date with any future content.The final version of the application is planned for release on the Google Play Store once API integration is completed.
